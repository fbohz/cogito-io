Big business key success is replication. Making something simple and being able to be duplicated. Duplicate product and human power. McDonalds learn how to duplicate with small business owners. Uber very easy to duplicate themselves and don't need a fleet of taxis.

All successful business build online communities. For Apple main source of revenue is the app stores. iPhone is platform to build community. All apps on phone, Apple is making money. Facebook makes thousands per friend you have. If you have 100 friends imagine how much you're helping make Facebook.

For first 20 years Apple wasn't well positioned it took them a lot of capital and work to be positioned. 

## How to Scale and Become Financially Independent

4 Models to Leverage:

1) *Franchise*: McDonalds. Good success rate. Every dollar invested can be returned. Don't have to have own idea from scratch. "Secure" investment. Downside it is very expensive. It needs a lot of capital. If you have a franchise you cannot duplicate yourself, you have to open new franchise under main franchise.

2) *Network Marketing / Direct Selling*: Multi-level marketing. Basically through people that connect with it. Long history. Vendor company and you can sell for them, then get to be a salesman. Some successful companies use this model. Downside is lack of regulation. For each person using this platform create different business. More than 90% either sale or recruit. Recruit is like getting everyone they know into their network. Usually there's no education system to tell how to approach this system. Some people want to get reach easily. 90% of people quit this system fast. Always Be Closing. But a good salesman is very *hard* to teach. *Hard to replicate* into B quadrant successfully. 

Some benefits of it:
- *Cheap*: couple hundred dollars. Operational costs less.
- *Tax Deductible*: You can get deductions
- *Build your own franchise under the model*: You can replicate and move into B quadrant.

3) *Agency Model*: E.g. you are a successful lawyer you have your own agency. Lawyers to start have their own mentor and at first become part of an agency. The agency at the beginning share everything so you can learn. From making profit when independent you can give a percentage of your success. E.g. 5% of profits. Agencies can be duplicated. Agency invest a lot in the person but there is a high vetting process. Downside is that you cannot control who will be successful first or second. Is up to the person under the agency when will they be successful. 

Agency model *puts people before process*. It will be a while before this people will become profitable. If you are a mentor and your mente does something wrong, the client can sue you or your company can get in trouble.
   
4) *Affiliate Market*: Leverage other service. Other companies want to be part of the network. Become ambassadors towards certain products. 

**How to leverage this 4 business models**:

- *Creating revenue*. Learn how to convert all our expenses into our own business. Get more wholesale price. Recommend with friends. If they also like it they can purchase from me. Get loyal customers that buy consistently from you.
- *Duplicate ourselves*: Build a team, an online community. Identify this people and put in a process so they can become part of the business and duplicate whatever they do.
- *Education*: Spend most time nurture ourselves and building our own assets (personal economy). If you don't have the right skills you won't be able to attract the right people. You need to become an attractive/smart person to attract those people to you. 

Reason for This Process:

- Credentials Vs. Character -> Mutual Trust and Transparency
- Facts. Vs. Opinion -> Education. Get out of employee/customer point of view. 
- Build case for yourself. Integrity and Accountability. 
- People before profits. People are the assets. Level of ambition. 

Start your own process

- Write down what's important for you. Write with pencil and paper.
- Focus on top 3.
- Focus on duplicating yourself.
